# Damage-Modeling-in-Metal-Additive-Manufacturing-Process-Simulations

This is a Fortran 77 script written for a master's thesis by Carter J. Fietek at New Mexico State University. The script is designed to implement the Johnson-Cook plasticity and failure model into Abaqus Standard. The script interfaces with Abaqus standard as a UMAT (user material subroutine) through the Intel Fortran Compiler.

Documentation, validation, and use of this subroutine is detailed in the thesis found at https://doi.org/xxxxxxx
